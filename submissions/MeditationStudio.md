**Site name:** Meditation Studio (App)

**URL:** http://www.meditationstudioapp.com/

**Short description:** An app (iOS) that offers access to hundreds of short, guided meditations.

The app is simple and pleasant to use, and it makes it easy to find meditations with a specific focus (stress, sleep, happiness, etc.) or to just explore. It's also easy to keep track of the meditations that work for you, so you can listen to them again later.
