Site name: 750 Words

Short description: Online, always private, blank page for anything you want to say. Yell at your ex. Write a note to your great grandmother. Dream about your upcoming vacation. Clear your head so you can get back to business. The site's goal is built around The Artist's Way's suggestion to do three pages of free-association writing first thing in the morning. It incentivizes getting to 750 words each day, writing without interruption, and streaks but it doesn't punish you if you use it differently. Exports are available.
