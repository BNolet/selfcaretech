**URL:** https://kierantie.com/burnout/

**Short description:** The author describes his own struggle and recovery from burnout. Most importantly, he outlines that burnout isn't always caused by overwork. He identifies 6 reasons: 

* **Lack of control.** Not having a lot of say about your work, or your sense of control is undermined or restricted.
* **Values conflict.** A disconnect between your own core values and those of the organization.
* **Insufficient reward.** Feeling under-compensated, under-appreciated, and taken for granted.
* **Work overload.** Your workload is too much, too urgent, or too complicated.
* **Unfairness.**  Youâ€™re treated poorly by the organization, or management plays favorites.
* **Breakdown of community.** Patronizing colleagues, no-one to talk with about conflicts, and feedback is non-existent.
