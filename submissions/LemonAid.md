# LemonAid Slack Community

**Site name:** LemonAid

**URL:** http://lemonaid.io/

**Short description:** LemonAid offers an active, supportive community where you can unload your struggles and share successes anonymously. They believe in openly speaking about mental health, trauma, human rights and professional challenges. As of now, the community is open for those who are female-identifying, but they are working to expand that. Check out the website, or just join the [Slack Group](https://nicole64.typeform.com/to/MKsY8J).
